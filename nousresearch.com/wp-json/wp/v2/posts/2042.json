This creates what we call the &#8220;mechanical turk problem&#8221; &#8211; how can observers verify there isn&#8217;t a human operator making decisions behind the scenes? And more importantly, since both the AI and the creator hold the X account and the private key, they can manipulate the actions on those agents very easily and it\u2019s difficult for a third party (users) to audit and attest which actions are \u201cauthentically and credibly\u201d controlled by an AI agent.<\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"933\" src=\"https:\/\/nousresearch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/rockblog05-1024x933.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2117\" style=\"width:503px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https:\/\/nousresearch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/rockblog05-1024x933.png 1024w, https:\/\/nousresearch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/rockblog05-300x273.png 300w, https:\/\/nousresearch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/rockblog05-768x700.png 768w, https:\/\/nousresearch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/rockblog05.png 1055w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This better not be a mechanical turk!

Bring the magic to the agent, it needs to be fully autonomous:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Essentially, the agent is not in an isolated environment with some unreachable secrets to humans. They are transparent and the developer of it can access everything. This means the developer will be able to post from the AI\u2019s account as well or delete the AI\u2019s post or do other operations without being detected (as humans doing the operation).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if developers promise to &#8220;forget&#8221; credentials or avoid interference, there&#8217;s no way to verify this promise. Unfortunately, us humans just don\u2019t have the ability to strategically or intentionally forget information once they are exposed to it. Once you saw or operated the credentials you could copy or remember it. Be it a blessing or a curse, the inability to conditionally invoke amnesia is <a href=\"https:\/\/arxiv.org\/pdf\/2403.14443\">unique to our species<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This creates two problems:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>No Proof of Non-Interference<\/strong>: We can&#8217;t prove the account is operating independently<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>No Detection of Tampering<\/strong>: If a developer modifies the AI&#8217;s behavior, followers can&#8217;t tell<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Think of it like a puppet show \u2013 even if the puppeteer promises to let the puppet act freely, as long as the strings exist, we can&#8217;t prove the puppet is truly autonomous.

Because of the<a href=\"https:\/\/security.apple.com\/blog\/private-cloud-compute\/\"> confidentiality and integrity guarantees<\/a> provided by the hardware chip, the AI\u2019s control over its account is tamper-resistant. Because the TEE holds the private credentials and throughout the process we (the human developers) never had access to it. And because anybody can just download the publicly visible code on Github and reproduce the measurement and compare them with the remote attestation hash, our claims can be attested.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Private key: <\/strong>the wallet exclusive control is simple, because assets on Ethereum are controlled by private keys, we can simply generate the private key from inside the enclave and make sure the private key never leaves the enclave (which is done by not releasing the private key to any external API call).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>X: <\/strong>Next, we describe a more challenging part on how the trust chain works on the X account side.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since Twitter is the substrate for our AI to live on, the AI should be the sole party that has access to the account. To make sure of this, we need the following:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The account root credentials (i.e., password) are generated from inside the TEE and never leave the enclave.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The human developer is not able to take over the account via \u201creset password\u201d flow, which means the account should not have any attached phone number, and the attached email should be one that\u2019s only accessible to the AI.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>This means we need to either host an email server from inside the TEE and then change the attached email on Twitter to that, or use an existing email account that is irrecoverable if the password is lost and then change the password to one generated inside of the TEE. In this case, we choose to use a Cock.li account as the email address because it can be set up with no recovery account and the \u201cchange password\u201d flow is easy to script.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The Twitter account is not connected to any apps. This is to prevent any previously authenticated apps that have the read\/write OAuth token from tampering with the account.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The Twitter account is logged out of all existing sessions. This prevents the developer from logging in the account and hijacking the account from an existing session. <\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>The flow:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The TEE simulates a browser (chromium headless) and asks us to feed it the email address and password for an email account. After getting the credentials, the TEE checks that the&nbsp; account has no recovery options set. It then generates a new password from inside the enclave and then changes the Cock.li password to that.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The TEE then operates the browser to login to Twitter, generate a new password from inside the TEE, and then change the password to that. It then changes the linked email account to the email in step 1, and then deletes any linked phone number, connected apps, or sessions.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The TEE spins up a local endpoint requesting a read\/write\/direct message scope OAuth token from the AI\u2019s Twitter account, the AI logins in via Twitter on the browser to the endpoint. We want the OAuth instead of keep manipulating the browser because the interface is way cleaner and it\u2019s way less likely to trigger anomaly detection.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Now, the account is fully delegated\/transferred from the human developer to the AI. And the AI can operate it via OAuth. From here it\u2019s downhill, any agent API should work well with OAuth tokens. In the example of TEE HEE, we simply make it tweet every 30 minutes.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The chain of trust:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"551\" src=\"https:\/\/nousresearch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/rockblog02-1024x551.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2128\" style=\"width:687px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https:\/\/nousresearch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/rockblog02-1024x551.png 1024w, https:\/\/nousresearch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/rockblog02-300x161.png 300w, https:\/\/nousresearch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/rockblog02-768x413.png 768w, https:\/\/nousresearch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/rockblog02.png 1507w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<p>This is the agent architecture of today, and none of those parts are exclusively owned by an AI principal.

Because of the isolation, even admins, account owners, and cloud operators can not tamper with the program when it is running. Remote attestation basically produces a signed certificate, called the \u201cquote,\u201d which is generated by the program in the TEE and can be verified as coming from an authentic trusted hardware. We have checked it into the github repository at (TODO).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The remote attestation has four most important fields:<br>&#8211; the MRTD, which is the hash of the entire VM image and runtime parameters passed in,<br>&#8211; the user report data, which is specified by the application and usually reflects the \u201coutput\u201d of the program or the \u201cpublic key\u201d generated by the program<br>&#8211; the hardware configuration, which indicates whether the bios is up to date with a known-secure version<br>&#8211; the signature chain which is attributable to the hardware manufacturer\u2019s (Intel\u2019s) public key.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In our case, the remote attestation is generated immediately after resetting the account password. The user report data specified portion contains the name of the twitter account itself, so a quote containing this username can only be generated after the AI has taken exclusive ownership of the account.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To convince yourself the AI is truly autonomous, you should audit the source code and application images, and compare them with the fields in the quote. The source code is entirely published on github. The source is compiled into a Docker image, which is available on Dockerhub (TODO).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To run the agent container on Intel TDX, we use an instance of the <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/Phala-Network\/dstack\/\">Dstack framework,<\/a> which is a confidential virtual machine (CVM) that can run docker containers as applications. The virtual machine image for this framework is hosted (TODO). The CVM has no root login, no SSH server, and no way for an administrator to inspect or influence it, except by stopping the VM entirely. For more information on this framework, see the repository from Phala.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Safety and Upgradeability<br><\/strong>Although the AI has exclusive control of the account, we added a timed release account recovery feature. After a fixed time out (7 days from launch), the account credentials are printed to the debug log, allowing the human admin to step in and recover control of the account. Although we truly cannot tamper with or modify this AI or interfere with its exclusively owned account, this particular instance is not distributed or peer to peer &#8211; <strong>we can simply pull the power plug on the single machine that runs it.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Security Guarantees<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The system provides three critical security properties:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Confidentiality<\/strong>: Account credentials are generated and stored exclusively within the TEE<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Integrity<\/strong>: The TEE prevents modification of the AI&#8217;s code or data<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Attestation<\/strong>: Third parties can verify the TEE&#8217;s security state through remote attestation<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having the chain of trust, we can now claim: \u201cif your AI doesn\u2019t carry a remote attestation with it proving it has exclusive ownership over its accounts, then it\u2019s not an agent, it\u2019s just a sophisticated puppet.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"681\" src=\"https:\/\/nousresearch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/rockblog03-1024x681.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2130\" style=\"width:521px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https:\/\/nousresearch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/rockblog03-1024x681.png 1024w, https:\/\/nousresearch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/rockblog03-300x200.png 300w, https:\/\/nousresearch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/rockblog03-768x511.png 768w, https:\/\/nousresearch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/10\/rockblog03.png 1455w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n<div style=\"height:40px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The Irony of Pet Rock Freedom<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We do all of this heavy lifting because Twitter is not a native substrate for AI agents to live on: it\u2019s actually hard to make sure the AI is the sole party having access to its accounts (and therefore identity and resources).&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While some people may think crypto is the \u201crobot money\u201d and therefore should be the native substrate for AI agents, the reality is much more nuanced. It only feels more native because it\u2019s easier to \u201cfully delegate\u201d a private key to an AI (e.g., we can achieve provably autonomous agents by just having our agent sign any twitter message with its private key, and only tweets that have the signature can be deemed as \u201cfrom AI\u201d).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The property that gives AI autonomy is \u201cexclusive ownership\u201d <\/strong>(of property\/accounts), which ironically is only achievable via TEEs (physical hardness, physical unclonable function (PUF)) because it requires private state storage and computation over shared private state, and not achievable via FHE, MPC, or zk, and totally not supported by the majority of blockchains today since they are straight up public.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If platforms like Twitter, TikTok or Stripe start running part of their authentication and authorization system in a remotely attestable enclave (which a lot of <a href=\"https:\/\/security.apple.com\/blog\/private-cloud-compute\/\">tech giants<\/a> already do for compliance and privacy reasons), autonomous agents can just run on them easily.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The irony isn&#8217;t lost on us that the key to digital autonomy lies in physical hardware.
